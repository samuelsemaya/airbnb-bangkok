# Background and History of Airbnb in Bangkok
---
## Overview
---
Airbnb is an online marketplace that connects people who want to rent out their homes with those looking for accommodations. Founded in 2008, Airbnb has become a significant player in the hospitality industry, offering unique lodging experiences in over 220 countries and regions worldwide. The platform allows property owners to rent out their spaces, whether it be an entire home, an apartment, a private room, or a shared room.

## History of Airbnb in Bangkok
---
Airbnb began operating in Bangkok a few years after its founding. As the popularity of tourism in Bangkok increased, the platform saw a surge in the number of listings and users. Bangkok, as one of the most popular tourist destinations in the world, offers a variety of accommodations through Airbnb, ranging from modern apartments in the city center to traditional houses in the suburbs. However, with this rapid growth came various challenges that needed to be addressed to ensure service quality and customer satisfaction.

In 2025, a major event will be held in Thailand, the SEA Games Thailand 2025, which will take place from December 9, 2025, to December 20, 2025. The event will be participated in by 11 Southeast Asian countries, with Bangkok being one of the host cities.

## Challenges Faced
---
Biennial events will certainly lead to a surge in renters, both from domestic and international tourists. Sports events held at Rajamangala National Stadium in the Bang Kapi district, as one of the main venues, will definitely draw attention.

As a data analyst working in Airbnb rental services, you will be dealing with several stakeholders with vested interests, including:

| **Stakeholders**            | **Description**                                                                                                          |
|-----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Airbnb Hosts**            | Property owners renting out homes or apartments through Airbnb, property managers responsible for guest accommodations and comfort.   |
| **Local Government**        | Bangkok and Thailand governments responsible for regulations and policies, Bangkok tourism authorities.                  |
| **Airbnb Thailand Team**    | Local Airbnb Thailand team managing operations and support, customer service providing support in Thailand.                |                |

<br>

Stakeholders naturally hope to maximize their potential revenue and increase their popularity, including hosts, the local government, and Airbnb itself. Additionally, data analysts need to ensure an even distribution of rentals across districts so that it is not concentrated in just one district near the stadium hosting the event, for example.

We will try to answer the following questions:  

<div class="alert alert-block alert-info"><span style="color:black">
<b>What can hosts, the local government, and the Airbnb Thailand team do for domestic and international tourists to enhance the excitement of the SEA Games Thailand 2025 event?</b></div></span>
